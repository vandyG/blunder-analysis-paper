\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

This section presents empirical findings from the processed Lichess sample. Unless stated otherwise, an ``error'' denotes any move classified as Inaccuracy, Mistake, or Blunder via the winning chance delta thresholds (Section~\ref{sec:problem_formulation}).

\subsection{Error Rates Across Elo and Time Controls}
Error prevalence generally declines with increasing Elo across time controls (Figures~\ref{fig:elo-blitz}--\ref{fig:elo-standard}), but the pattern of decline depends strongly on rating strata and time control. The steepest slope of decline occurs among the very highest-rated players (Elo $>2600$), who show marked reductions in error rates relative to slightly lower tiers. Longer time formats (Rapid and Standard) exhibit a larger decline in errors across Elo than Bullet; Bullet still shows a noticeable improvement for the top ($>2600$) players but the gradient is less pronounced than in longer formats.

Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bullet (Figure~\ref{fig:elo-bullet})}: Error proportions are elevated at lower Elo and improve with rating, suggesting pattern recognition and practical skills partially compensate for extreme time pressure.
  \item \textbf{Blitz (Figure~\ref{fig:elo-blitz})}: Shows a sharper decline across Elo than Bullet for higher rating bands, reflecting that modestly longer decision time reduces time-induced noise.
  \item \textbf{Rapid (Figure~\ref{fig:elo-rapid})}: Transitional regime; error rates fall more substantially with Elo than in Bullet/Blitz with higher-rated players.
  \item \textbf{Standard (Figure~\ref{fig:elo-standard})}: Distinct profile: higher-rated players (Elo >2400) make significantly fewer errors, while lower-rated players continue to exhibit relatively high error rates, producing a more bimodal-like relationship between Elo and error prevalence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Move-level time usage (time\_ratio)}
The per-move time usage is summarized by the ratio
\[
	ext{time\_ratio}_t = \frac{(\text{clock}_{t-1} + \text{increment}) - \text{clock}_t}{\text{clock}_{t-1} + \text{increment}},
\]
which measures the fraction of the available clock at move $t$ that was consumed making that move. Values near $0$ indicate very quick moves (including pre-moves or routine, low-effort moves), while values near $1$ indicate that almost the entire available time allotment was used.

Empirically (Figure~\ref{fig:time_ratio}), the proportion of moves classified as errors increases with `time\_ratio` across all fast time controls. Key patterns:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Monotonic increase:} Error proportion rises from low `time\_ratio` (quick moves) up through intermediate values, with a clear upward trend for Bullet and Blitz and a milder slope for Rapid. This suggests that moves made after spending a larger share of available time are, on average, more likely to be errors than very quick, routine moves.
  \item \textbf{Stronger effect in faster controls:} The steepest increase appears in Bullet and Blitz, consistent with time-pressure amplifying decision noise. Rapid shows a similar shape but lower overall error proportions.
  \item \textbf{Extreme-value volatility:} At very high `time\_ratio` (close to 1.0) the series becomes noisy, with occasional spikes and abrupt drops. Those features are at least partly sampling noise: very few moves consume essentially the entire allotment in some bins, producing high variance in the empirical proportion.
  \item \textbf{Interpretation hypotheses:} Low `time\_ratio` often corresponds to low-complexity positions or automatic pattern play (hence low errors). Larger `time\_ratio` can represent either (i) genuinely harder positions requiring long calculation (increasing error risk despite more time), or (ii) extreme time pressure where players are forced to use most of their remaining clock repeatedly and still make mistakes.
\end{itemize}

For modeling, `time\_ratio` should be included as a non-linear predictor (e.g., spline or low-order polynomial) and interacted with time-control category and Elo. Additionally, control for move phase and position-sharpness metrics to disambiguate whether high `time\_ratio` reflects complexity or time-scramble. Finally, use binning or variance-aware smoothing and report counts per bin to avoid over-interpreting noisy extremes.

\subsection{Piece-Type Error Distribution}
Figure~\ref{fig:piece-error} reports error composition by moved piece. Knights and Queens show relatively higher severe error proportions compared to Pawns. Hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Knights}: High branching tactical motifs; miscalculation of knight forks and intermediate squares leads to larger evaluation drops.
  \item \textbf{Queens}: Centralization and overextension errors produce large tactical liabilities when tempo is misjudged.
  \item \textbf{Pawns}: Majority of pawn moves produce incremental positional shifts, hence lower severe error proportion; inaccuracies dominate rather than blunders.
  \item \textbf{Rooks/Bishops}: Intermediate; their long-range nature creates both strategic and tactical opportunities but fewer catastrophic single-move losses than queen blunders.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
Across temporal regimes, cognitive/time resource compression elevates both frequency and severity of errors. The steeper error gradient in faster controls suggests that time scarcity interacts multiplicatively with positional complexity. Piece-type analysis reinforces that tactical density (knights) and high-value tempo (queens) amplify blunder risk. Collectively, these findings motivate modeling approaches incorporating (i) dynamic time-pressure features (e.g., remaining clock normalized by increment and move phase), (ii) local tactical complexity proxies (sharpness, contempt variants), and (iii) piece-specific interaction terms.

Future work will regress blunder probability against a joint feature set including sharpness metrics and temporal ratios to quantify marginal contributions and interaction effects.
